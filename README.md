This project is designed to help track revolving cash back reward categories on credit cards. Credit cards with cash back features frequently have predetermined purchase categories eligible for cash back rewards based on the date. This console app conveniently tracks which reward category is active for the current date. The app will ask first to enter a nickname for a credit card. This can be any name, and is designed to help a user with multiple credit cards track each card. In the future this app will be able to store multiple card information. Then, the user adds the reward category to the respective time of year the category is active. Most commonly these categories include: "retail stores", "grocery stores", "restaurants", and "gas stations". The app then can output the current active reward category based on the date.
Three features used include a master loop, reading data from a text file and using the data in the app, and calculating display data based on an external factor.
